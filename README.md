# SpaceAI Interactive Poster Session

This repository contains the skeleton website for the SpaceAI interactive poster session hosted by the International&nbsp;Space&nbsp;University (ISU).  The site is designed for deployment on GitHub&nbsp;Pages and follows ISU’s branding guidelines (blue and white palette and clean sans‑serif typography).  It is intended as a starting point that student teams can fork and extend with their own interactive posters.

## How to use this repository

1. **Fork the repository.**  Each team should create their own fork so that their changes don’t interfere with other groups.  Rename your fork using your team number or topic, e.g. `team-1-engineering`.
2. **Create a subdirectory for your poster.**  Inside your fork, add a folder under `posters/` named after your topic or team.  Place a single `index.html` file (plus any assets such as scripts, style sheets, data or images) inside this folder.  Your poster must be a single HTML page – scrolling down is allowed, but multiple pages are **not**.  The main `index.html` file in the root of the repository should not be modified except to add links to your poster.
3. **Use vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**  Frameworks such as React or Vue are not allowed.  Feel free to include libraries like [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) or D3.js to add interactivity.  If you include external libraries, use a CDN (Content Delivery Network) link.
4. **Follow the design guidelines.**  Use ISU’s blue (RGB 0 20 84) and white palette.  For typography, choose a legible sans‑serif font such as Calibri.  Keep your layout clean and uncluttered – leave space between sections and avoid overcrowding with too much text.
5. **Tell a story.**  Your poster is a narrative tool, not just a data dump.  Start with a clear problem statement, explain your methods and findings, and finish with the impact and next steps.  Use visuals (charts, diagrams, timelines, maps) to illustrate your story.  Avoid jargon and tailor the level of detail to a broad audience.  Keep your message concise – focus on two or three key findings.
6. **Use accessible fonts and sizes.**  Titles should be at least 40‑80 px tall, section headers 24‑28 px, main text 14‑18 px, and footnotes or captions 8‑12 px.  Provide sufficient contrast between text and background colours for readability.
7. **Submit your poster by the deadline.**  Final posters are due by **12 November 2025** so that we can review them before the main event.  Open a pull request from your fork to this repository to submit your poster.
